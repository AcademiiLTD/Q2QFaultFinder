        _bodyText: 'The Q2Q device pinpoints the location of a fault on the network
          where two phases are welded together, by taking readings whilst switching
          loads in and out.


          From the on load testing it calculates distance
          to fault. The user inputs cable information on the touch screen until the
          device offers a geographical location of the fault. Step by step instructions
          for operation are presented on the display screen. Follow these instructions
          and answer the on-screen questions.'
